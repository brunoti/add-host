# Add Host (add-host)

A simples, very simple, script to add an host to your host file!
Just because i think that is boring to aways open an editor just to add an single line on this file.

## How to use
The inital idea just adds the phrase you pass to the script with the default localhost ip: ``127.0.0.1``.  

Install it: ``$ npm instal -g add-host``

This: ``$ sudo add-host mybeaultifulsite.dev``  

Adds this: ``127.0.0.1 mybeaultifulsite.dev`` to your hosts file.
